# HTML Links, CSS Layout, JS Functions

### HTML Links

- Links are the defining feature of the web
because they allow you to move from
one web page to another — enabling the
very idea of browsing or surfing.

 -Creating inks between pages
 ***When you are linking to other
pages within the same site,
you do not need to specify the
domain name in the URL. You
can use a shorthand known as a
relative URL.***

-Example:
<li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>

<li><a href="about-us.html">About</a></li>


- Linking to other sites

***Users can click on anything that
appears between the opening
<a> tag and the closing </a>
tag and will be taken to the page
specified in the href attribute.***

-Example:
-<a href="http://www.empireonline.com">
Empire</a>

- Email links

it starts
with mailto: and is followed by
the email address you want the
email to be sent to.



# Layout in Css:-
----------------------------------
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
* The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width).

* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.


 # Functions, Methods, and Objects:-
* Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 
* Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.
