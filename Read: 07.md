# Layout in Css:-
----------------------------------
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
* The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width).

* Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
