- **Headings**
HTML has six "levels" of headings: 
<h1> is used for main headings 
<h2> is used for subheadings If there are further sections under the subheadings then the <h3>
element is used, and so on.
The contents of an 
<h1>element is the largest, and the contents of an <h6>
element is the smallest.

- **Paragraph**
<P> To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening 
tag and closing </p>
tag.

- ***Bold and italic***

<b> 

If you want to make your characters appear bold use <b> one word or more than </b><i
<i> tag
If you want to make your e characters appear italic. Use <I> </i>

- **superscript & Subscript**
we use <sup> tag to make superscript for characters 
we use <sub> tag to make subscript for characters

 <b />
if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag

## CSS

* CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear.

1- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look. 

2- Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like). 3- Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.

3- Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface. 

4- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

Statements should end with a semicolon ; .
