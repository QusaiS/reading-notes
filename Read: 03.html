<h1>What Is Wireframing?</h1>
<p> <strong>Wireframing</strong> is a layout of a web page that demonstrates what interface elements will exist on key pages. It is a critical part of the interaction design process.

<h2>Advantages of Wireframing</h2>

<p><em><strong>One of the great advantages of wireframing is that it provides an early visual that can be used to review with the client. Users can also review it as an early feedback mechanism for prototype usability tests. Not only are wireframes easier to amend than concept designs, once approved by the client and the users they provide confidence to the designer.

From a practical perspective, the wireframes ensure the page content and functionality are positioned correctly based on user and business needs. And as the project moves forward they can be used as a good dialogue between members of the project team to agree on the project vision and scope.</em></strong></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<P>
Wireframes should be used early in a project to get user and client approval on the layout of key pages and the navigation. This will provide the project team, specifically the designers, confidence in moving forward. Wireframes will also save considerable time and money in the testing and amends phase later in the project..</P>
