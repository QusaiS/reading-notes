# Local Storage:-
----------------------------------
* What we really want is **a lot of storage space** on the client that **persists beyond a page refresh** and **isn’t transmitted to the server**.
* Local storage start working correctly from Html5.
* HTML5 storage it’s a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser.
* Unlike cookies, Local storage data is never transmitted to the remote web server (unless you go out of your way to send it manually).

* The latest version of pretty much every browser supports HTML5 Storage… **even Internet Explorer!**
*  The storage event is fired on the window object whenever setItem(), removeItem(), or clear() is called and actually changes something.
* Web SQL Database (formerly known as “WebDB”) provides a thin wrapper around a SQL database.
