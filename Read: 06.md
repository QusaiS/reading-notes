# Programming with JavaScript

in the last lesson we talked about operators and exprision in JavaScript
* Today we will taik about **Function**
in JavaScript

## Function

_ **A function definition** (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:_

- The name of the function.
A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
- The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.

>### Predefined functions
JavaScript has several top-level, built-in functions:

- eval()

The eval() method evaluates JavaScript code represented as a string.

- uneval()

The uneval() method creates a string representation of the source code of an Object.

- isFinite()

The global isFinite() function determines whether the passed value is a finite number. If needed, the parameter is first converted to a number.

- isNaN()

The isNaN() function determines whether a value is NaN or not. Note: coercion inside the isNaN function has interesting rules; you may alternatively want to use Number.isNaN(), as defined in ECMAScript 2015, or you can use typeof to determine if the value is Not-A-Number.

- parseFloat()                            
The parseFloat() function parses a string argument and returns a floating point number.

- parseInt()

The parseInt() function parses a string argument and returns an integer of the specified radix (the base in mathematical numeral systems).

- decodeURI()

The decodeURI() function decodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) previously created by encodeURI or by a similar routine.

- decodeURIComponent()

The decodeURIComponent() method decodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) component previously created by encodeURIComponent or by a similar routine.
