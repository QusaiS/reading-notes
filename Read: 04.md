## Operators 

** JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator. A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator **
 



* ** there are many types of operator: **  
1-Assignment operators   
2-Comparison operators  
3-Arithmetic operators  
4-Bitwise operators  
5-Logical operators  
6-String operators  
7-Conditional (ternary) operator
8-Comma operator  
9-Unary operators  
10-Relational operators

### Exampels:

- Assign values to variables and add them together:
       
      
var x = 5;         // assign the value 5 to x
var y = 2;         // assign the value 2 to y
var z = x + y;     // assign the value 7 to z (5 + 2)

- The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.  
Assignment  
var x = 10;

- The addition operator (+) adds numbers:

Adding       
var x = 5;    
var y = 2;         
var z = x + y;
